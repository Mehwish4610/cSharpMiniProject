# C-# Mini Project

This repo contains a c# code for a menu driven program consisting of 12 distinct programs that can be run.


## Deployment

To deploy this project you can either run the exe file or download the code to run on any suitable editor.



## Features

The 12 distinct programs are as follows:
1. ### Calculator:
    This is a program to implement a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponential values, square root and cube root of given prompted nuumerics.
2. ### Program to check and list Armstrong's Numbers:
    This is a menu-driven program that helps you list armstrong's numbers from a given range or check if the prompted numeric ias an armstrongs number.
    #### Armstrong's Number:
    An Armstrong number is a positive m-digit number that is equal to the sum of the mth powers of their digits. It is also known as pluperfect, or Plus Perfect, or Narcissistic number. It is an OEIS sequence A005188.
3. ### Find Substrings:
    This programs takes in user input and gives all possible substrings of the input.
4. ### Divide By Zero Error Implementation:
    This program implements error and exception handling when a number is divided by zero.
5. ### Pascal's Triangle:
    This program implements Pascal's Triangle by taking in number of rows as user prompt.
    #### Pascal’s Triangle:
    Pascal’s Triangle is the triangular arrangement of numbers that gives the coefficients in the expansion of any binomial expression. The numbers are so arranged that they reflect as a triangle. Firstly, 1 is placed at the top, and then we start putting the numbers in a triangular pattern. The numbers which we get in each step are the addition of the above two numbers.

6. ### Floyd's Triangle:
    This program implements Flyod's Triangle by taking in number of rows as user prompt.
    #### Floyd's Triangle:
    The Floyd's triangle is a right-angled triangle that contains consecutive natural numbers. In Floyd's triangle, the number starts with 1 in the top left corner, and then it consecutive filling the defined rows through the numbers.

7. ### Read and Copy a .txt File:
    The following program reads and copies a user inputed file.
8. ### Stack Operations:
    This program implements the operation of a Stack.
    #### Stack:
    Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.

9. ### Addition and Subtraction Operatin on Complex Numbers:
    This program performs addition and subtraction operation on user inputed Complex Numbers.
10. ###  Polymorphic Shape Drawer:
    This program is a simple implementation of concept of polymorphism, where different shapes are drawn and erazed.
    #### Polymorphism:
    Polymorphism is often referred to as the third pillar of object-oriented programming, after encapsulation and inheritance. Polymorphism is a Greek word that means "many-shaped" and it has two distinct aspects:
- At run time, objects of a derived class may be treated as objects of a base class in places such as method parameters and collections or arrays. When this polymorphism occurs, the object's declared type is no longer identical to its run-time type.
- Base classes may define and implement virtual methods, and derived classes can override them, which means they provide their own definition and implementation. At run-time, when client code calls the method, the CLR looks up the run-time type of the object, and invokes that override of the virtual method. In your source code you can call a method on a base class, and cause a derived class's version of the method to be executed.
11. ### Perimeter Calculator for Rectangle and Circle:
    This program calculates perimeter of user inputed rectangle and circle using the concept of abstract claas.
    #### Abstract Class: 
    In C#, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated. Instead, it serves as a base class for other classes to inherit from. Abstract classes are used to define a common set of behaviors or properties that derived classes should have.
12. ###  Resizable Rectangle:
    This is a menu-driven program resizes the width and height of a rectangles original dimensions to user inputed values using the concept of interference.
    #### Interference:
    Like a class, Interface can have methods, properties, events, and indexers as its members. But interfaces will contain only the declaration of the members. The implementation of the interface’s members will be given by class who implements the interface implicitly or explicitly.

- Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how.
- Interfaces can’t have private members.
- By default all the members of Interface are public and abstract.
- The interface will always defined with the help of keyword ‘interface‘.
- Interface cannot contain fields because they represent a particular implementation of data.
- Multiple inheritance is possible with the help of Interfaces but not with classes.
